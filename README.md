# Urban Pavement Inspection and Assessment

Urban pavement systems play a critical role in ensuring safe and comfortable transportation for both pedestrians and vehicles. The condition of these pavements directly impacts factors such as ride comfort, road safety, and overall user experience. Therefore, effective inspection, assessment, and maintenance of urban pavements are essential for maintaining optimal conditions and ensuring the well-being of the public.

Traditionally, pavement inspection and assessment have been carried out through manual surveys and visual inspections. While these methods provide valuable information, they often rely on subjective judgments and can be time-consuming. Moreover, they may not fully capture subtle variations and potential issues that could impact comfort and safety.

Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning have opened up new possibilities for enhancing pavement inspection processes. By harnessing the power of AI, it becomes feasible to process and analyze large volumes of data from various sources, such as images, sensor readings, and pavement characteristics. This can lead to more accurate and efficient identification of pavement conditions, as well as predictive capabilities for future degradation.

In this project, we aim to implement an AI-driven approach for automated data processing in urban pavement inspection. By combining computer vision techniques with machine learning algorithms, we seek to develop a model capable of assessing pavement conditions, predicting potential comfort and safety issues, and providing valuable insights for effective maintenance strategies.
